	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(
"abstract	Indicates that the details of a class, a method, or an interface are given elsewhere in the code.
assert	Tests the truth of a condition that the programmer believes is true.
boolean	Indicates that a value is either true or false.
break	Jumps out of a loop or switch.
byte	Indicates that a value is an 8-bit whole number.
case	Introduces one of several possible paths of execution in a switch statement.
catch	Introduces statements that are executed when something interrupts the flow of execution in a try clause.
char	Indicates that a value is a character (a single letter, digit, punctuation symbol, and so on) stored in 16 bits of memory.
class	Introduces a class – a blueprint for an object.
const	You can’t use this word in a Java program. The word has no meaning. Because it’s a keyword, you can’t create a const variable.
continue	Forces the abrupt end of the current loop iteration and begins another iteration.
default	Introduces a path of execution to take when no case is a match in a switch statement.
do	Causes the computer to repeat some statements over and over again (for example, as long as the computer keeps getting unacceptable results).
double	Indicates that a value is a 64-bit number with one or more digits after the decimal point.
else	Introduces statements that are executed when the condition in an if statement isn’t true.
enum	Creates a newly defined type — a group of values that a variable can have.
extends	Creates a subclass — a class that reuses functionality from a previously defined class.
final	Indicates that a variable’s value cannot be changed, that a class’s functionality cannot be extended, or that a method cannot be overridden.
finally	Introduces the last will and testament of the statements in a try clause.
float	Indicates that a value is a 32-bit number with one or more digits after the decimal point.
for	Gets the computer to repeat some statements over and over again (for example, a certain number of times).
goto	You can’t use this word in a Java program. The word has no meaning. Because it’s a keyword, you can’t create a goto variable.
if	Tests to see whether a condition is true. If it’s true, the computer executes certain statements; otherwise, the computer executes other statements.
implements	Reuses the functionality from a previously defined interface.
import	Enables the programmer to abbreviate the names of classes defined in a package.
instanceof	Tests to see whether a certain object comes from a certain class.
int	Indicates that a value is a 32-bit whole number.
interface	Introduces an interface, which is like a class, but less specific. (Interfaces are used in place of the confusing multiple-inheritance feature that’s in C++.)
long	Indicates that a value is a 64-bit whole number.
native	Enables the programmer to use code that was written in another language (one of those awful languages other than Java).
new	Creates an object from an existing class.
package	Puts the code into a package — a collection of logically related definitions.
private	Indicates that a variable or method can be used only within a certain class.
protected	Indicates that a variable or method can be used in subclasses from another package.
public	Indicates that a variable, class, or method can be used by any other Java code.
return	Ends execution of a method and possibly returns a value to the calling code.
short	Indicates that a value is a 16-bit whole number.
static	Indicates that a variable or method belongs to a class, rather than to any object created from the class.
strictfp	Limits the computer’s ability to represent extra large or extra small numbers when the computer does intermediate calculations on float and double values.
super	Refers to the superclass of the code in which the word super appears.
switch	Tells the computer to follow one of many possible paths of execution (one of many possible cases), depending on the value of an expression.
synchronized	Keeps two threads from interfering with one another.
this	A self-reference — refers to the object in which the word this appears.
throw	Creates a new exception object and indicates that an exceptional situation (usually something unwanted) has occurred.
throws	Indicates that a method or constructor may pass the buck when an exception is thrown.
transient	Indicates that, if and when an object is serialized, a variable’s value doesn’t need to be stored.
try	Introduces statements that are watched (during runtime) for things that can go wrong.
void	Indicates that a method doesn’t return a value.
volatile	Imposes strict rules on the use of a variable by more than one thread at a time.
while	Repeats some statements over and over again (as long as a condition is still true).")
